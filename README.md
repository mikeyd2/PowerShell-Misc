# PowerShell-Misc

Smaller scripts and functions I've made repeated use of. Time-savers, quality-of-life-uppers & the like. Nothing fancy.

## Contents

- **Read-DistinguishedName.ps1**: Takes the distinguished name of an AD object or string and returns either the domain of that object or the top-most parent OU; if neither option is specified, returns the distinguished name by default. 


## Usage

Goes nicely in a moudule and loaded into the shell session on start-up.
